    "<b>Materials</b>: See \"Using Jupyter Notebook and Python on Google Colab\" page on Canvas (under Modules>Resources) for information on how to use Google Colab to use Jupyter Notebook. We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages, <b> except </b> Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Gensim, Keras and Pytorch. You must export your Colab notebook and submit it to the LMS. If your notebook doesn't run, you will lose marks. <b> You should use the Python version that's on Google Colab (3.11)</b>.  \n",

You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each question is worth is explicitly given. \n",

We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.

The test set should contain 1000 word types, and the rest should be in the  training set. Note that we are intentionally making the hangman game hard, as the AI will need to cope with test words that it has not seen before, hence it will need to learn generalisable patterns of characters to make reasonable predictions.\n",

You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training.

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",
    "- You should build a **standard bigram language model**; i.e. do not do anything complicated like a bidirectional bigram language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "* When testing your AI model's performance, you may want to consider trying different training/test splits (using different seeds) to have a better understanding of its _average_ performance, as there will be some variance to its performance depending on the training/test split.\n",
